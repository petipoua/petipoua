I'm building websites, currently working on:

\- zenkan.app : a flexible note taking & kanban app with satisfying sounds and rich text for personal use.
\- CTRL KAI: a chrome extension where you press CTRL+K to open an AI Popup for quick AI summary/questions of the current webpage, without switching tabs.
